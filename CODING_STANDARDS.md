# Python Learning

Welcome to the Python Learning repository! This repository is organized into different folders, each covering various topics and concepts in Python. We follow certain coding standards to ensure clean and readable code.

## Clean Coding Standards

- **Meaningful Names**:
  - Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and modules.
  - Example: Use `greet_user` instead of `g`.

- **Consistent Naming Conventions**:
  - Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
  - Use `CamelCase` for class names.

- **Avoid Magic Numbers**:
  - Use constants for fixed values.
  - Example: Instead of using `3.14` directly, use `PI = 3.14`.

- **Modular Code**:
  - Break down large functions into smaller, reusable functions.
  - Keep functions focused on a single task.

- **Comments and Docstrings**:
  - Write comments to explain the why, not the what.
  - Use docstrings to describe the purpose and usage of modules, classes, and functions.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
  - Example: Use `try-except` blocks to catch and handle errors.

- **Code Formatting**:
  - Follow PEP 8 guidelines for code formatting.
  - Use consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks.
