## Applying Pareto Principle for Learning Python

In this repository, we apply the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to focus on the key concepts that will give you the most significant benefit for learning Python automation. This means focusing on the 20% of topics that will be used in 80% of your Python automation tasks.

### Key Concepts for Python Automation

1. **Scripting Basics**
   - Writing and executing scripts
   - Understanding command-line arguments
   - Using `if __name__ == "__main__":`

2. **File Handling**
   - Reading from and writing to files
   - Working with CSV and JSON files

3. **Libraries and Modules**
   - Using standard libraries like `os`, `sys`, `datetime`
   - Installing and using third-party libraries (e.g., `requests`, `boto3`)

4. **Error Handling**
   - Try/except blocks
   - Logging errors

5. **Automation Tools**
   - Task scheduling (using `cron` or `schedule` library)
   - Interaction with web APIs (using `requests`)

By focusing on these key areas, you will build a strong foundation in Python that will enable you to automate tasks efficiently and effectively.
